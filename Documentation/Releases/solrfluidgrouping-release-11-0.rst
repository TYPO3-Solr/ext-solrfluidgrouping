============================================================
Apache Solr for TYPO3 - Grouping for Fluid templating 11.0.0
============================================================

We are happy to release EXT:solrfluidgrouping 11.0.0
The focus of this release has been on the EXT:solr 11.5 and TYPO3 11 LTS compatibility

As we're planning to simplify the maintenance, we want to merge EXT:solrfluidgrouping into EXT:solr.
So this will happen most probably in EXT:solr 12.0.0.

New in this release
===================

TYPO3 11 LTS and EXT:solr 11.5 compatibility
--------------------------------------------

EXT:solrfluidgrouping is now compatible with TYPO3 11 LTS and EXT:solr 11.5

Small improvements and bugfixes
-------------------------------

Beside the major changes we did several small improvements and bugfixes:

* [BUGFIX] Fix PSR-4 Namesppaces and Paths
* [TASK] Fix GitHub-Actions and TYPO3 coding standards
* [BUGFIX] Exception on argument mismatch
