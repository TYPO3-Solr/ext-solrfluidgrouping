============================================================
Apache Solr for TYPO3 - Grouping for Fluid templating 10.0.0
============================================================

We are happy to release EXT:solrfluidgrouping 10.0.0
The focus of this release has been on the EXT:solr 11.1 compatibility

This is the first public release of EXT:solrfluidgrouping.

We thank our sponsors who made the development possible. Again, we welcome further sponsorship or active contribution to the codebase.
After releasing the first version of solrfluidgrouping in 2017 for TYPO3 8.7, we are now very happy to release the 5th and most recent
version 10 and to make it available for everyone.

As we're planning to simplify the extension and dependency handling we're harmonize the extension version with TYPO3. So the next version
of solrfluidgrouping is 10.0.0 and compatible with TYPO3 10 LTS.

New in this release
===================

---------------------------

EXT:solrfluidgrouping is now compatible with EXT:solr 11.1

Drop TYPO3 9 compatibility
